            <p class="long_text">
                But you, maybe, will ask me: "For what you created the math game? This is so boring!". I'll answer: Yes. This is why I 
                decided to do so. I created the math game to make the studying of this more fun and easier to understand. I am sure
                that this game will help everyone who wants to understand mathematics and test their skills against others, but cannot, 
                for example, because of the bad quality of education in math course, school, with tutor and etc. If you recognized 
                yourself around them, this game is to help you!
