This is my favorite project, because I like math. 

Currently, this website has 4 pages. The first one is "Home" page. To be honest, it only has some text, like "welcome to us!" and "here you can do..." stuff. 

The second one is "About" page - also blank, but I am going to add some information in the future. 

And the "Practice" page - it has links to a several lessons and levels. Now, only one level is available. However, this level has its own problem-generation and scoring systems. 

When user starts this level, the website generates an arythmetical problem, choosing two one-digit numbers and choosing between addition or substration by random. Also, the website generates 4 choices, where the numbers are also chosen by random. Before appending, website makes one of the existing choices equal to the correct answer. Then, when a user clicks on one of the provided choices, the website compares the chosen value it to the correct answer value. If the values match, a user receives a score. If not, then the amount of score remain unchanged. When a user reaches the last problem, the button "Next" disappears because user doesn't need it anymore. And when user clicks the "Finish" button, the website shows an alert message, where he shows how many points out of the maximum (basically 5) a user got. After finishing, a button "Play again" appears.  This way, user can play this game again without refreshing a page.
