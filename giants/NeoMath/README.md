This is my favorite project, because I like math. 

Currently, this website has 4 pages. The first one is "Home" page. To be honest, it only has some text, like "welcome to neomath" and "here you can do..." stuff. 

The second one is "About" page - also blank, but I am going to add some information in the future. 

And the "Practice" page - it has links to a several lessons and levels. Now, only one level is available. However, this level already has its own problem-generation and scoring systems. 

When user starts this level, the website generates an arythmetical problem, choosing two one-digit numbers and choosing between addition or substration by random. Also, the website generates 4 choices, where the numbers are also chosen by random. Before appending, website makes one of the existing choices equal to the correct answer. Then, when a user clicks on one of the provided choices, the website compares the chosen value it to the correct answer value. If the values match, a user receives a score. If not, then the amount of score remain unchanged. When a user reaches the last problem, the button "Next" disappears because user doesn't need it anymore.
