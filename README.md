Welcome to my repository, dear reader! My name is Mark Samoilov. In this README file, I will briefly describe what do I make here.


In this repository, I have three types of projects: ants, medium, and cities. Each of type of these projects have their own folder and unique characteristics, and I will explain all of them in a moment.

In folder called "ants", I have many projects that are generally small in code (usually a few decades of strings), and very easy to understand, just like "to-do list". I make them generally for practicing, especially while learning something new or reviewing something I probably forgot.

Next, the "medium". Just like the "ants", this folder contains projects where the original idea is the usage of a specific coding tool.

And, finally, folder "giants". In accordance to the name, here are the projects that are very very big in code as well as wide in functionality. Unlike the "ants" and "medium", they are designed not only to practice, but also to show my overall mastery in web development.
