Welcome to my repository, dear reader! My name is Mark Samoilov. I am actively learning front-end development (HTML/CSS/JS + React) and looking for an entry-level job. In this README file, I will briefly describe things I make here.

In this repository, I have three types of projects: babies, medium, and giants. Each of type of these projects have their own folder and unique characteristics. Find out more in folders with corresponding names.
