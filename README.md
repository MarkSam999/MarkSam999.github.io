Welcome to my repository, dear reader! My name is Mark Samoilov. In this README file, I will briefly describe what do I make here.


In this repository, I have three types of projects: villages, towns, and cities. Each of type of these projects have their own

In folder called "villages", I have many projects that are generally small in code - a few decades of strings, and very easy to understand. In these projects, I mainly use HTML for structuring and CSS for styling. Sometimes, you may see JavaScript code, because. I make them generally for practice, especially while learning something new or reviewing something I probably forgot.

In folder called "towns".

And, finally, folder "cities". In this folder, I make the projects that are designed not to show what did I learn, but to show my overall experience in web development. Here you will see  codes written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
