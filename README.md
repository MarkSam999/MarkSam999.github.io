This is the personal repository of me, Mark Samoilov. Right here, I have all my projects that I make for fun & experience.

In "frontend" folder, I have projects, where I use HTML/CSS/JS only (sometimes, with some add-ons).

In "backend" folder, I have projects that were written on a programming language like Python, Node.js, etc.

In "full-stack" folder, I have projects where I use both frontend and backend technologies.
