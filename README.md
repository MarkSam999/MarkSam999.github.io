Welcome to my repository, dear reader! My name is Mark Samoilov. In this README file, I will briefly describe what do I make here.


In this repository, I have three types of projects: ants, towns, and cities. Each of type of these projects have their own folder and unique characteristics, and I will explain all of them in a moment.

In folder called "ants", I have many projects that are generally small in code (usually a few decades of strings), and very easy to understand, just like "to-do list". In these projects, I mainly use HTML for structuring and CSS for styling and ensuring it won't look like boring. But sometimeds, you may see JavaScript code in these projects. I make them generally for practice, especially while learning something new or reviewing something I probably forgot.

In folder called "medium", I do . Like the "villages", these projects are practical, so, they may seem too simple.

And, finally, folder "cities". In this folder, I make the projects that are designed not to show what did I learn, but to show my overall experience in web development. Here you will see codes written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
