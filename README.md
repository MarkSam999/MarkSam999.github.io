Welcome to my repository, dear reader! My name is Mark Samoilov. In this README file, I will briefly describe what you could find here.


For the first, I will describe what is contained in every folder:

In folder called "infantry", I have many projects that are generally small, but simple. Similar to medieval soldiers: easy to produce and train, but weak when fighting alone and strong as a horde.

In folder called "cavalry", I have projects that are simple too, but unlike the "infantry" projects, they are larger in code and has wider functionality. Like cavalry units, they are faster and more powerful than the infantry soldiers, but usually harder to produce because along an armor and a weapon for a rider, a horse, saddle, and a horse armor are needed too.

And, finally, folder "artillery". In this folder, I have projects that are the largest I've ever created. Like the heavy artillery units, they are expensive in production and reload too slowly. But every shot leads to an explosion that could smash a house and to scare the entire city.


Next, I will list the technologies I use for making my own websites and explain how do I use them:

HTML - as known across many web-developers, HTML serves as a constructor of any website. Through HTML, I build the structure for my websites by typing them in Visual Studio Code.

CSS - literally "style settings". Thanks to this, I can set any color, any position, any size, any animation and many many more for my HTML elements.

JavaScript - similar to Python, but designed for websites. Using JavaScript, I can make the entire functions that could be caused by any event like loading a page or clicking a button. For example, I make for loops for repetitive tasks, if-else statements - to set conditions for any possible scenario, append() - to make something appear on a page.
