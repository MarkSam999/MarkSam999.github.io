Welcome to my repository, dear reader! My name is Mark Samoilov. In this README file, I will briefly describe what do I make here.


For the first, I will describe what is contained in every folder:

In folder called "infantry". I have many projects that are generally small in code (a few decades of strings) and simple. I make them generally for practice, especially while learning something new.

In folder called "cavalry".

And, finally, folder "artillery". In this folder, I have projects that are the largest I've ever created. Like the heavy artillery units, they are expensive in production and reload too slowly. But every shot leads to an explosion that could smash a house and to scare the entire city.
